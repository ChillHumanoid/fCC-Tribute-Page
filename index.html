<!--History of Einstein-->
      <div id="tribute-info">
        <h2>A Brief History of Albert Einstein </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Einstein was born in 1879 in Germany. His parents were a young Jewish couple.</li>
          <li>Einstein always enjoyed science and similar subjects in school, but was opposed to the strict rules and conformity.</li>
          <li>At age 10, a family friend named Max Talmud, began recommending science and philosophy books to Einstein.</li>
          <li>Einstein’s family moved to Italy in 1893, and it was at this time that he decided he would drop out of school and renounce both his Jewish faith and his German citizenship.</li>
          <li>Einstein applied to study at a Swiss technical institute called Zurich Polytechnic, but he was denied due to failing his entrance exams. He was accepted a year later after extensive studying.</li>
          <li>Between the years of 1896 and 1900, Einstein was participating in a teachers’ training program at Zurich Polytechnic, and this is where he met two of his lifelong friends, along with his wife, Mileva Maric.</li>
          <li>After completing the teachers training program in 1900, he worked as a mentor and teacher all over Germany and Switzerland.</li>
          <li>He finally settled down in 1902 with his wife in Bern, Switzerland. They went on to raise two sons together.</li>
        </ul>

  <!--Life Achievements-->
        <h2>Life Achievements and Awards</h2>
        <p id="extra"><i>Einstein greatly contributed to many of the most important scientific advancements in modern times, such as space exploration, applications of light, and atomic energy. He also made many breakthroughs in the fields of gravity, matter, and time.</i></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Einstein was awarded a Nobel prize In 1921 for his contributions to theoretical physics.</li>
          <li>Einstein answered the question of: “why is the sky blue?”</li>
          <li>He was somehow able to assert the equivalence of energy and mass. This led to the famous formula: E = mc2.</li>
          <li>Einstein was awarded the Max Planck medal by the German Physical Society for achievements in the field of theoretical physics.</li>
          <li>Einsten was awarded the Franklin INstutie's "Franklin Medal" in 1936 for his work on relativity and photo electric effect.</li>
        </ul>
